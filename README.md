# AWS-Certification-SAA-C02
My notes for the newer version of the AWS Solution Architect Associate 

This is a compilation of information from various sources that I used to study for the AWS Solutions Architect - Assocciate certification. 
Do note that AWS introduces changes quite frequently and hence the best place for clearing your doubts any topic is the AWS documentation.

Here are some of the references that I found really useful for my prep.

The freecodecamp course on youtube:

(this course does not cover the newer topics introduced for the newer C02 version of the exam however the hands on excercise are great for getting your basics right)

See this article for a list of new topics included in C02.

I do recommend going for the whizlabs practice tests, they are a great help to get into the exam mode one you are done studying and really help you with time management.  
The nature of questions is also pretty close to what you get in the exam. It is not a perfect question bank but it is worh the investment.
